# Web App Template

This repository is a cookiecutter template for bootstrapping a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python backend, a [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript frontend, a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) relational database, and a [Redis](https://redis.io/) cache and message broker. These services are containerised using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and can be deployed using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) locally. 

Cloud deployments coming soon...
